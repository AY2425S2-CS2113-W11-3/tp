- **Highlights**:
    - Designed the parsing structure and create a skeletal code for others so that they can create command easier.
    - Includes exception handling for invalid tags, duplicated tags and missing tags 
    - Reject invalid inputs due to wrong command name
- **Technologies**: Java I/O, JSON serialization

#### 2. Trip Class
- **What it does**: Represents the core data model for a trip, including its name, description, and associated photo album.
- **Highlights**:
    - Added missing compulsory parameter error to detect missing input.

#### 3. TripManager Class
- **What it does**: Manages a collection of `Trip` objects, including logic for adding, removing, and listing trips.
- **Highlights**:
    - Add mechanism where the trip can not be added to trip manager due to duplicated trip name

#### 4. Photo Class

#### 6. TravelDairy Class
- **What it does**: Runs the main software function.
- **Highlights**:
    - Collaborated with `Ojassurana` to create the main function of the code based on his previous IP.
    - Design the logic on how to track the fsm value.

#### 7. Commands and commandFactory Classes
- **What it does**: Execute commands based on parser output and connects them to trip, tripmanager and photos.
- **Highlights**:
    - Collaborated with `Ojassurana` to crea
    - Create exceptions to reject photos with missing metadata values, eg. missing gps data.
